I am a posdoc researcher ([ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6017-9300)) at LERMA, Observatoire de Paris (PSL), Paris, France. 

I work in the research groups of [Andrea Ciardi](https://sites.google.com/site/andreaciardihomepage/home) (LERMA & Sorbonne University) and [Julien Fuchs](https://luli.ip-paris.fr/en/scientists/equipes-de-recherche/sprint-sources-de-particules-rayonnement-intenses) (LULI & Ecole Polytechnique). 

My research focuses on both laser-plasma physics and magnetized laboratory astrophysics, with the methods of both advanced computational modeling (by using PIC/MHD/MHD-PIC codes) and high-power laser experiments (at APOLLON, VULCAN, and LULI2000).
